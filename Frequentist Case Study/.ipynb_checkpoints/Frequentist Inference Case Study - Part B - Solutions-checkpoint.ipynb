    "Welcome to part B of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply in Python the concepts associated with Frequentist inference: the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

Recall that in the previous assignment, we introduced the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and its consequence that the distributions of sample statistics approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases. The amazing thing about this is that it applies to the sampling distributions of statistics that have been calculated from even highly non-normal distributions of data! Recall, also, that hypothesis testing is very much based on making inferences about such sample statistics. You're going to rely heavily on the CLT to apply frequentist (parametric) tests to answer the questions in this notebook."

However, the hospital is not particularly concerned here with the charges in individual cases, but rather the charges in aggregate. A metric of real interest to an administrator would be the expected total charge for a given number of cases; in other words, for a given number of patients treated, what charges would we expect to bill? Here, the number of cases is simply a scaling factor and we may equivalently talk about the mean value. A key value of interest here is indeed the mean and we are interested in making inference about that. The CLT tells us that we can expect this statistic to approach a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma / \\sqrt n$, where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are the population mean and standard deviation. We do not, however, know these parameters and they must be estimated from our sample. Whilst we can generally trust that this consequence of the CLT holds true, we can never know how close we are to achieving it for a given sample size in any particular problem. In this case, the appropriate test is the _t_-test."
